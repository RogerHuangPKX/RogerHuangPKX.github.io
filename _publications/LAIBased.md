title: "Comparison of Inversion Methods for Maize Canopy Time-series LAI Based on SupReME Reconstructed Images."
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/LAIBased
excerpt: 'The Sentinel-2 images are reconstructed by the SupReME algorithm to obtain rich spatial features and consistent spectral reflectance.
The reconstructed images are more advantageous for LAI estimation than the original images.
The PROSAIL coupled RF model is verified to be an effective method for time-series LAI estimation at 10 m spatial resolution.'
