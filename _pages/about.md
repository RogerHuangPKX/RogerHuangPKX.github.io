Jinze Huang, a Senior Student in China Agricultural University, majors in Computer Science, College of Information and Electrical Engineering. Since 7 years old, I showed stong interests in Computer, I bought newspaper called "The Computer Newspaper" to keep track of the computer. In 2010, my mom brought me a computer with GT 9800. I usually disassembled and assembled my PC during my breaking time. After The National College Entrance Examination, I chose Computer Science without any hesitation. Whenever I sit in front of the computer, as long as I write code, I will feel energized and full of motivation to learn more.

Research Area 
======
Like many other students in my school, I currently focus on Computer Vision.
* Objects Classification
* Objects Detection
* Lightweighting network

Projects
-----
> Sorted by time

1. **2022-01~2022-02 Intern at Institute of Semiconductors, China Academic of Science.**

    At Image Perception Computing Project Group, Laboratory of High-Speed Circuits and Neural Networks, IIS of CAS. I used Nerual Network to recognize human body's bone keypoints, then reconstructed the human from image to 3D Shape. And search the Acupuncture Point by reconstructed 3D Human and reflect back to 2D image.
2. **2021-03~2022-03 Beijing Innovation and Entrepreneurship Project,CAU**

    By assisting from Yaojun Wang, my tutor in CAU, I started a project focused on one-stage apple leaf disease detection(Classification and Detection). I used YOLO V5 as base model and approved that. I conßcatenated different networks' blocks to improve accuracy and decrease the net's parameters.
3. **2019-11-2021-01 School-level Innovation and Entrepreneurship Project,CAU**

    This project was started at my first year in university, I developed a desktop application with YOLOv3 to classify different fruits such as apple and banana via images or real-time cameras.
